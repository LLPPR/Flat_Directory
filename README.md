### Flat Directory Script

## Description
The `flatten_directory.py` script flattens a given directory up to a specified level, making it easier to manage files by reducing nested folders. It also provides an option to undo the changes ~~when~~ if needed.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LLPPR/flatten-directory.git
   cd flatten-directory
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python flatten_directory.py <directory> <levels>
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to provide the path to your root directory and the number of directory levels to flatten to. The script will ask if you want to undo the changes after execution.
